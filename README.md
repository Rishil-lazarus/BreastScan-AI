An AI-powered web application for breast cancer detection using deep learning models. Upload medical images and get instant classification results for benign, malignant, or normal breast tissue.

## Overview

BreastScan-AI is a machine learning project designed to assist in the early detection of breast cancer by classifying medical images into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal. The application uses state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a curated dataset of breast tissue images. It features a user-friendly web interface built with Flask, allowing healthcare professionals and researchers to upload images and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores.

The project addresses the critical need for accessible and accurate diagnostic tools in medical imaging, potentially reducing diagnostic time and improving patient outcomes through AI-assisted analysis.

python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
import numpy as np

# Load model
model = load_model('vgg16_breast.keras')

# Prepare image
img_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224), color_mode="grayscale")
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0) / 255.0

# Make prediction
predictions = model.predict(img_array)
class_idx = np.argmax(predictions[0])
classes = ["benign", "malignant", "normal"]
print(f"Prediction: {classes[class_idx]}")
