# BreastScan AI

BreastScan AI is a deep learning–based system for the automated classification of **breast ultrasound images** into three categories: **Benign, Malignant, and Normal**.
The project integrates a **VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with a **Flask web application**, allowing users to upload grayscale ultrasound images, view prediction results with confidence levels, and download structured PDF reports.

**Disclaimer:** This project is not medically certified and is intended for research and educational purposes only.

## Overview

Breast cancer remains a major global health concern, with millions of new cases each year. While ultrasound imaging is a widely used diagnostic method, manual interpretation can be time-intensive, error-prone, and inconsistent.

BreastScan AI addresses these challenges by providing an AI-powered second-opinion tool. Through transfer learning and fine-tuning of the VGG16 architecture, the system achieves expert-level accuracy and offers a user-friendly platform for real-time analysis of breast ultrasound images.

## System Architecture

1. **Frontend**

   * Built using HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript
   * Key pages: `index.html` (upload), `about.html` (project details), `result.html` (predictions and reports)

2. **Backend**

   * Implemented using Flask (Python)
   * Handles file upload, preprocessing, model inference, and report generation

3. **Model**

   * Transfer learning with VGG16 (ImageNet weights)
   * Architecture: Global Average Pooling → Dense(256, ReLU) → Dropout(0.5) → Dense(3, Softmax)
   * Outputs: Benign, Malignant, Normal

---

## Dataset and Preprocessing

* **Dataset**: Grayscale ultrasound images categorized into three classes (Benign, Malignant, Normal)
* **Preprocessing steps**:

  * Resize to 224×224
  * Convert grayscale to RGB (3 channels)
  * Normalize pixel values to range [0,1]
* **Data Augmentation**: Horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, brightness/contrast adjustment, cropping, zooming
